We use Biome to format and lint the node project.

### Github Actions

Biome runs during CI to make sure it's linted and formatted correctly.

### local

After doing changes, run:
```bash
yarn check
``` 
to see if there are anything that needs to be fixed

if there are any safe fixable changes it recommends, run:
```bash
yarn check-fix
```

Unsafe fixes should be fixed manually, and check if it still builds by running:
```bash
yarn build
```
